# interface - summary

1. Interfaces helps in maintaining scalability in GO. They are "type" in go just like struct.

2. Stuct are basically data container since they hold data but interface is behviour container since it describe behaviour

3. We dont explicity use implements keyword for interface. its implicit to GO

4. We can create our own implementation of inbuild method also. (like Write method of I/O library)

2. Interface composition (interface of interfce)

3. Empty interface
